# Forest-Fire
A model for dynamical systems displaying self-organized criticality.

Consider the following model of the spread of a forest fire. Suppose that at t = 0 the L * H sites of a square lattice either have a tree or are empty with probability p and 1âˆ’p, respectively. The sites that have a tree are on fire with probability f. At each iteration an empty site grows a tree with probability g, a tree that has a nearest neighbor site on fire catches fire, and a site that is already on fire dies and becomes empty. This model is an example of a probabilistic cellular automaton.
